This is the Github code corresponding to the paper
[Aarset, Christian: *Global optimality conditions for sensor placement, with extensions to binary low-rank A-optimal designs*, Inverse Problems 41 065013 (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6420/add9bf)

Its aim is to provide a high-efficiency, general code for A-optimal experimental design for Bayesian linear inverse problems.
